        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Marco (Kwok To, Chan). For over 10 years, I worked at a packaging manufacturing company in Hong Kong that was headquartered in Germany. This experience allowed me to collaborate with talented designers and renowned brands, inspiring me to transition into the design industry. Additionally, I completed a web design and programming diploma 10 years ago, which further fueled my interest in deepening my knowledge in this field.</p>
        <p>Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active by playing soccer and table tennis. I am passionate about sports and often explore the city to discover new experiences and adventures.</p>
